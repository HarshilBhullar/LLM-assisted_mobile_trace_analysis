Prompt: I want you to define a class `ModifiedLteRlcAnalyzer` that inherits from a base `Analyzer` class, and analyzes link layer information with specific focus on RB configurations and throughput calculations:

1. Class Definition: `ModifiedLteRlcAnalyzer`
This class extends from a base `Analyzer` class. It should set up a callback function that processes different types of RLC messages. The class should maintain state information for RB configurations and calculate throughput with adjusted calculations.

2. Analyzer Configuration and Message Processing
- `set_source`: This method should configure which logs to enable for analysis. Specifically, it should enable "LTE_RLC_UL_Config_Log_Packet", "LTE_RLC_DL_Config_Log_Packet", "LTE_RLC_UL_AM_All_PDU", and "LTE_RLC_DL_AM_All_PDU".
- `__msg_callback`: This method should handle message callbacks for the configured logs. It should:
  - Process "LTE_RLC_UL_Config_Log_Packet" and "LTE_RLC_DL_Config_Log_Packet" to track active and released RBs.
  - Process "LTE_RLC_UL_AM_All_PDU" and "LTE_RLC_DL_AM_All_PDU" to calculate cumulative data and throughput. Adjust calculations by multiplying PDU bytes by 1.1 for throughput.
  - Log instantaneous throughput for RB configurations with a specific format, ensuring that calculations are adjusted accordingly.

3. State Management and Calculations
- Maintain a dictionary `rbInfo` to store information about each RB, including cumulative data and lists of sequence and acknowledgment numbers for UL and DL.
- Ensure calculations for throughput and frame cost are adjusted by a factor of 1.1 where appropriate.
- Log results with detailed information about RB configuration indices, timestamps, and calculated throughput or frame cost.

4. Output
The class should log relevant metrics such as throughput and frame costs with adjusted calculations to provide insights into link layer performance.
