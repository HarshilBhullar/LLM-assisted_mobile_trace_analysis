I want you to define a class `myAnalyzer` that inherits from a base `Analyzer` class, and returns statistics for attach events: 

1. Class Definition: `myAnalyzer`
The constructor initializes the `Analyzer` base class, sets up message counters for authentication requests, security commands, 
attach accepts, attach requests, and attach rejections.
The class should read in incoming and outgoing NAS ESM and EMM packets. 
The `__msg_callback` function processes each message by decoding the data and examining XML content to identify specific NAS message 
types like attach requests, attach accepts, attach rejections, 
authentication requests, and security mode commands. It updates the respective counters.

2. Analysis Function: `my_analysis`
Initialize an `OfflineReplayer` as the data source, setting the input path for the trace logs.
Configure the source with an instance of `myAnalyzer` and runs the analysis. It should include error handling to manage exceptions 
that might occur during execution, providing feedback if the analysis fails.

3. Main Function:
After successfully running the analysis, the script gathers the counts of each event type from the analyzer.
It compiles these statistics into a row format and appends them to a CSV file named 'attach_stats.csv'. This file logs the input file
path and counts of authentication requests, security commands, attach accepts, attach requests, and attach rejections.
