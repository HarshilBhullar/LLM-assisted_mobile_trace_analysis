        "evaluation": "To evaluate the semantic equivalence of the two outputs, we need to focus on the core information they convey, which is the count of occurrences for each state. Let's break down the outputs:\n\n**True Output:**\n- State CELL_FACH occurred 0 times\n- State CELL_DCH occurred 0 times\n- State URA_PCH occurred 0 times\n- State CELL_PCH occurred 0 times\n- State IDLE occurred 0 times\n\n**Generated Output:**\n- RRC State CELL_FACH: 0 occurrences\n- RRC State CELL_DCH: 0 occurrences\n- RRC State URA_PCH: 0 occurrences\n- RRC State CELL_PCH: 0 occurrences\n- RRC State IDLE: 0 occurrences\n\n**Comparison:**\n1. **State Names:** Both outputs list the same states: CELL_FACH, CELL_DCH, URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, and IDLE. The generated output prefixes these with \"RRC State,\" but this does not change the meaning of the states themselves.\n\n2. **Occurrence Counts:** Both outputs indicate that each state occurred 0 times. The phrasing differs slightly (\"occurred 0 times\" vs. \"0 occurrences\"), but the numerical values are identical.\n\n3. **Formatting and Naming Conventions:** The differences are purely in formatting and naming conventions (e.g., \"State\" vs. \"RRC State\" and \"occurred 0 times\" vs. \"0 occurrences\"). These do not affect the semantic content of the outputs.\n\nSince the core information\u2014the count of occurrences for each state\u2014is the same in both outputs, they are semantically equivalent despite the differences in wording and formatting.\n\n**Decision: 0 (equivalent)**",
