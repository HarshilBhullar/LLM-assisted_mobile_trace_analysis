For NAS EMM packets (both incoming and outgoing), it parses XML data to check specific NAS message types (Attach accept, Service accept, Service reject, and Control plane service request) and updates respective counters based on the contents. For RRC packets, it prints \"log_msg_len\" and \"timestamp\" data fields, if present.\n",

    "    - Sets the file path for the input data and configures the source with the `myAnalyzer` instance.\n",
    "    - Runs the analysis by processing the trace data through the source. Any exceptions during this process are caught and reported.\n",
    "    - Returns the configured and used analyzer instance for further use or querying of the collected data.\n",
